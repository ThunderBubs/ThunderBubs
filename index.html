		<b> Legend Of Zelda Breath Of The Wild - Hylian Shild </b>
			<p> The lockup (whick you can enter by lifting the entrence gate with magnesis) fetures multiple cells behind which enemys are 
				  trapped. You can accsess them all by opening doors via levers or destructible walls - they all lead to minor tressure. 
					The grand prize, though, is found in the final room to the right. After eliminating a Stalnox sub-boss, you earn the right to 
					collect the best shild in the game; link's hylian shild ( the master shild ). This fetures unequald stats, making it a fantastic 
					assist in the epic fight against Gannon. Defeting the Stalnox should pose no perticular problem at this stage; just dont forget 
					to hit its eye when it falls on the floor with only a fraction of its helth left. Once the Hylian shild is yours, backtrack
					to the entrence and this time head through the main tunnel leading to the Docks.
